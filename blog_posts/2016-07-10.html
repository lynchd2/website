    <h1>Week 1: Object-Oriented Ruby and RSpec</h1>
    <p class="blog-date">July 10th, 2016</p>
</br>
</br>
</br>
    <p>Before the first day, which started last tuesday, we had a lot of prep work to do. We had to complete a number of readings the went over software engineering as a whole, which is available on the Viking Code School website for anyone to do. Once we were finished with that, we had to start going through the first three units of the curriculum, which is how the material is divided.</p>
    <p>The first unit was a simple getting started unit, the second was a unit on HTML, CSS and Bootsrap, and the third was on the basics of Ruby. So before me and everyone else in my cohort started our 16 week adventure, many of us had a solid grounding in web development basics through the prep work. Well I am finally at the end of week 1 and here is my impression!</p>
    <p>Our first three days consisted of building games, like Connect Four, Tower of Hanoi, to practice Objected-Oriented Programming. We learned the basics concepts and best practices when it comes to centering our written code around the breakdown of objects. I've been really trying to write code around what I found to be two very important princples:
        <ul>
            <li>You can never have too many classes in Ruby.</lu>
            <li>If your methods are more than 10 lines long, then you are probably not following the "S" in the SOLID princple.</li>
        </ul>
    <p> Of course there are other important aspects of the SOLID philosphy, like open-closed princple(O) and dependency inversion(D). I feel that ThoughBot's post <a href="https://robots.thoughtbot.com/back-to-basics-solid">here</a> also gives a "solid" and quick explanation of the SOLID principle</p>
    <p>The last day was spent picking up RSpec. RSPec is simply a gem consisting of three other gems that tests your ruby code. We will be using RSpec the second week for creating the game Minesweeper but under the TDD philosophy, or writing our tests out first before writing the Ruby code. This encourages writing the minimal amount of ruby possible in order to pass each test, as well as ceating modular code</p>
    <p>The second week brings more TDD and Algorithms, and I am really excited to learn more!</p>
